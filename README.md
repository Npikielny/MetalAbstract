# Metal Abstract
Metal Abstract or abstracted metal is essentially an interface that allows the user to write metal code with significantly less boiler-plate and technical know-how.

## Ideology
There are a few things that annoy me personally with the MetalKit API, which are the number of descriptors with properties that are hard to find and don't feel particular swifty. There are other oddities like allocating memory or just learning all of the components of the API that can be a bit of a headache, so this library attempts to eliminate as much of that as possible. Everything is loaded when you need it, and it hopefully plays well with Swift and requires less GPU knowledge than MetalKit itself.
